        - Instructor course (each of instructors courses).
    - A Classes Page where I impalement:
        - All the classes approved by the admin. 
        - I showed the classes as a card. In the card I have the class picture, class name, instructor name, instructor email, available sits and the class price and also a button to select the class (an student can select the from the classes page.)

        - If the you login in as a student:
            - After clicking to the dashboard you will see a sidebar and also the content of the sidebar. In the sidebar content as a student you will see your selected classes and your enrolled classes. If you select any class you can pay for your class. After paying for your class it will remove from the selected classes page and then it will added to the enrolled classes page

In the sidebar content as an instructor you will have Add a class page where you can add your classes and a My class page where you will see the classes you have added and you can see your class status whether the admin approved your class or not. if the admin approve your classes you will see the approved status and if the admin deny your classes you will see the deny status and I have also added added a feedback column where a you can see the feedback given by the admin for you.
        - If the you login in as a Admin:
            - After clicking to the dashboard you will see a sidebar and also the content of the sidebar.
